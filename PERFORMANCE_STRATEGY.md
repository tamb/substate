# Performance Testing Strategy - Environment-Aware Thresholds

## 🎯 Problem Solved

**Original Issue**: Performance tests were failing in GitHub CI due to different hardware characteristics between local development machines and CI runners.

**Solution**: Implemented **environment-aware thresholds** that automatically adjust based on the execution environment.

## 🚀 Implementation Overview

### 1. Centralized Configuration (`performance-tests/config.js`)

- **Environment Detection**: Automatically detects CI vs local environments
- **Base Thresholds**: Tight thresholds optimized for local development
- **CI Multipliers**: Applied to base thresholds for CI environments
- **Maintainable**: Single source of truth for all performance thresholds

### 2. Environment Detection

```javascript
const isCI = process.env.CI === 'true' || process.env.GITHUB_ACTIONS === 'true';
```

### 3. CI Multipliers

```javascript
const CI_MULTIPLIERS = {
  time: 3.0,      // CI operations are typically 3x slower
  memory: 2.0,    // CI memory usage can be 2x higher
  cpu: 2.5        // CI CPU operations are typically 2.5x slower
};
```

## 📊 Threshold Examples

### Local Development (Tight Thresholds)

```javascript
// Shallow State - Small
creation: 0.15ms        // 150μs
singleUpdate: 0.2ms     // 200μs
avgUpdate: 0.005ms      // 5μs
memoryKB: 150           // 150KB
```

### CI Environment (Relaxed Thresholds)

```javascript
// Shallow State - Small (with CI multipliers)
creation: 0.45ms        // 150μs * 3.0
singleUpdate: 0.6ms     // 200μs * 3.0
avgUpdate: 0.015ms      // 5μs * 3.0
memoryKB: 300           // 150KB * 2.0
```

## 🧪 Test Results

## 🔧 Usage

### Running Tests Locally
```bash
npm run test:performance        # Single run
npm run test:performance:avg    # Multiple runs for accuracy
```

### Running Tests in CI
```bash
# CI automatically detects environment and applies multipliers
npm run test:performance
```

### Simulating CI Environment
```bash
CI=true npm run test:performance
```

## 📈 Performance Metrics Covered

### Time Metrics
- **Store Creation**: Time to create new store instances
- **Single Update**: Time for individual state updates
- **Average Update**: Average time per update in batch operations
- **Property Access**: Time to access properties
- **Nested Access**: Time to access deeply nested properties
- **Event System**: Time for event firing and handling

### Memory Metrics
- **Memory Usage**: Estimated memory usage in KB
- **State Count**: Number of states in history
- **Memory Growth**: Memory usage over time

## 🎯 Success Criteria

### Local Development
- All metrics must pass tight thresholds
- Performance regressions caught immediately
- Development workflow remains fast

### CI Environment
- All metrics must pass relaxed thresholds
- Tests complete within reasonable time
- No false failures due to environment differences

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### CI Failures
1. **Check Environment**: Verify CI environment detection
2. **Adjust Multipliers**: Increase CI multipliers if needed
3. **Review Hardware**: Check if CI runner specs changed
4. **Performance Regression**: Verify if real regression vs environment issue

### Local Failures
1. **Check Hardware**: Ensure machine meets expectations
2. **Background Processes**: Close unnecessary applications
3. **Node.js Version**: Ensure expected Node.js version
4. **Real Regression**: Might indicate actual performance regression

## 📝 Best Practices

1. **Run Locally First**: Always test performance locally before pushing
2. **Use Multiple Runs**: Use `--runs=5` for statistical accuracy
3. **Monitor Trends**: Watch for gradual performance degradation
4. **Document Changes**: Document any threshold adjustments
5. **Environment Consistency**: Keep local and CI environments similar
